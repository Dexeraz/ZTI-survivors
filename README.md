Gameplay:
The game starts with a choice of two basic weapons from Vampire Survivors. The game generates randomly-generated tilemap chunks depending on where the main character goes. The game is designed to be fast-paced and should not take longer than 20 seconds to complete. In the original version, monsters were divided into waves, and the boss appeared after 20 minutes.

Characters (depending on the choice of weapon) have different statistics, as do the monsters. After obtaining a sufficient amount of experience points, your weapon will evolve and become stronger. Healing is passive, or you can destroy Props located on the map to heal.
